                    We may also share your personal data with third parties. This may be necessary to allow us to properly perform the agreement to which you are a party, or because we are subject to a statutory obligation to share your personal data.

                    Kinly does not store personal data longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. For some data we must observe mandatory retention periods, for instance due to tax legislation. In general, we aim to retain customer/vendor personal data for no longer than two (2) years, unless a longer or shorter mandatory retention period applies or retention of the specific personal data is necessary.
                </p>
